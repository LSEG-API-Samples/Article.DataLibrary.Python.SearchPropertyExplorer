# Accelerating Search: Unlocking the Power of Property Exploration

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The *SearchPropertyExplorer* API is a simple Python package, or module, included within the LSEG Data Library for Python, that accepts criteria allowing users to easily discover properties and values to be used within [Search](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/building-search-into-your-application-workflow). The module is a simple interface responsible for managing the manipulation of debug and metadata information.  The goal of this module is to hold financial properties, metadata, and data values, based on search criteria, that users can observe and interrogate at any time.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Accelerating Search: Unlocking the Power of Property Exploration](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/accelerating-search-unlocking-the-power-of-property-exploration) article published on the [LSEG Developer Community portal](https://developers.lseg.com).
